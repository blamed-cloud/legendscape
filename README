COMPILING
---------

On Linux, the command that I use is:
	
$ g++ -std=c++0x -o /path/to/outfile /path/to/source

Where source would be '/path/legendscape-x.x.cpp' (x's represent version numbers)
And outfile is the name of the executable you want to make. Usually '$HOME/bin/legendscape' or '$HOME/bin/legendscape-x.x'
Then, if your $HOME/bin/ directory is in your path, you can run it with:

$ legendscape

or

$ legendscape-x.x

But, if you don't have bin in your path, you can run it with:

$ ./legendscape

or

$ ./legendscape-x.x

HOW-TO-PLAY
-----------

Legendscape is a turn based strategy game where you buy units of different types to wage war against your opponent(s).
Each time you play, the game will randomly generate a new map to play on.
Below, I have a list of the different units and their stats, for reference.
At the beginning of the game, you will select a couple of game options:
1. Size of the Map
        As of right now, this is acually a command-line argument:
                $ legendscape-x.x
                $ legendscape-x.x S
                        both create a standard small map: 22 x 80
                $ legendscape-x.x M
                        creates a medium sized map: 30 x 100
                $ legendscape-x.x L
                        creates a large map: 46 x 196
                $ legendscape-x.x Y X
                        creates a custom map of: Y x X 
        NOTE: if the map would be too large for the terminal window, it *should* shrink to fit the window.
2. Number of players
        Select the number of players you want to use. As of right now, support for 2, 3, or 4 players is enabled.
3. Shroud on/off
        If shroud is on, players will start with most of the map a mystery, and it will be uncovered as they explore.
        If shroud is off, players know the terrain of the whole map from the start.
4. Fog of War on/off
        If Fog of War is on, the sections of map that the units are not currently looking at will be covered in fog, so they can see terrain but not enemy units.
        If Fog of War is off, once a tile has been seen, it remains uncoverd, and you can see terrain as well as any units on the tile.
5. Reinforcements on/off        * units purchased are placed next turn, not the turn they are bought
        If reinforcements are on, then players gain money from kills, and they can buy more units each turn (if they have the money)
        If reinforcements are off, then players cannot buy any more units.

Then, each team buys units in order: 1.BLUE, 2.RED, 3.GREEN, 4.YELLOW
Then, the game progresses in turns (in the same order as above) until one team is victorious.
On each turn, you have:
0. Reinforcement phase
	If reinforcements are on, and there are reinforcements to be placed, they are placed now
1. First Move Phase
        each unit you control can move up to their move-value.
2. Attack Phase
        each unit you control can attack once, if they have any viable attacks
3. Second Move Phase
        any units that have movement remaining, and that did not attack, can finish their move.
4. End Phase
        your turn is over. Play passes to the next player.
Also note that units are selected to move and attack in a unit selection system, during which the player may:
	view the hp of all units they can see (even the enemies)
	buy more reinforcements if the option is on.
	view the stats of all the unit types
	quit the current phase entirely and move on to the next
Once only one team has units on the field, that team wins.
