-------
WINDOWS
-------

For Windows, all you need to do is run the executable 'Legendscape.exe'
Although, you do need to make sure its in the same folder as the tileset and the font.

-----------
Linux & Mac
-----------

If you either don't know how, or don't want to compile from source, you should be able to run the windows exe in wine, and that should work just fine.

--------------------
DEPENDENCIES - Linux
--------------------

This game requires you to install SFML 2.1, which is available from: http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.1/

SFML can be kind of tricky to get working. It is available from the standard repositories (via apt-get on debian systems for example), but for me it only had 1.6
To get it to work, I installed 1.6 through the repo's which gave me all the dependencies it needed, then installed SFML 2.1 into /usr/local/
Then, I needed to delete the 1.6 linkers from /usr/lib/ so it would default to the 2.1 ones in /usr/local/lib/

-----------------
COMPILING - Linux
-----------------

On Linux, the command that I use is:
	
$ g++ -std=c++0x -o /path/to/outfile /path/to/source -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

Where source would be '/path/to/legendscape-x.x.cpp' (x's represent version numbers)
And outfile is the name of the executable you want to make.
You might want to keep the executable in the same folder as the source code because it requires the tileset and the font to be in the same folder.
Or, you could move the tileset and the font into $HOME/bin/ if that is easier.
So, outfile would be: 
'/path/to/source/legendscape' or '/path/to/source/legendscape-x.x'
or
'$HOME/bin/legendscape' or '$HOME/bin/legendscape-x.x'
Then, if your $HOME/bin/ directory is in your path, you can run it with:

$ legendscape

or

$ legendscape-x.x

But, if you don't have bin in your path (or you didn't put it in bin), you can run it with:

$ ./legendscape

or

$ ./legendscape-x.x

-----------
HOW-TO-PLAY
-----------

Legendscape is a turn based strategy game where you buy units of different types to wage war against your opponent(s).
Each time you play, the game will randomly generate a new map to play on.
Below, I have a list of the different units and their stats, for reference.
At the beginning of the game, you will select a couple of game options:
1. Number of players
        Select the number of players you want to use. As of right now, support for 1, 2, 3, or 4 players is enabled.
2. Number of computer players
        Select the number of computers you want to play against.
        Note that this will take away slots for human players, not add more computers.
2. Size of the Map
        S/M/L for small/medium/large
3. Shroud on/off
        If shroud is on, players will start with most of the map a mystery, and it will be uncovered as they explore.
        If shroud is off, players know the terrain of the whole map from the start.
4. Fog of War on/off
        If Fog of War is on, the sections of map that the units are not currently looking at will be covered in fog, so they can see terrain but not enemy units.
        If Fog of War is off, once a tile has been seen, it remains uncoverd, and you can see terrain as well as any units on the tile.
5. Reinforcements on/off        * units purchased are placed next turn, not the turn they are bought
        If reinforcements are on, then players gain money from kills, and they can buy more units each turn (if they have the money)
        If reinforcements are off, then players cannot buy any more units.
6. Money
        For small maps, multiples of 100 in [1000,2000]
        For medium maps, multiples of 100 in [1000,3000]
        For large maps, multiples of 100 in [1000,4000]

Then, each team buys units in order: 1.BLUE, 2.RED, 3.GREEN, 4.YELLOW
Then, the game progresses in turns (in the same order as above) until one team is victorious.
On each turn, you have:
0. Reinforcement phase
	If reinforcements are on, and there are reinforcements to be placed, they are placed now
1. First Move Phase
        each unit you control can move up to their move-value.
2. Attack Phase
        each unit you control can attack once, if they have any viable attacks
3. Second Move Phase
        any units that have movement remaining, and that did not attack, can finish their move.
4. End Phase
        your turn is over. Play passes to the next player.
        
Also note that units are selected to move and attack in a unit selection system, during which the player may:
	view the hp of all units they can see (even the enemies)
	buy more reinforcements if the option is on.
	view the stats of all the unit types
	quit the current phase entirely and move on to the next
	
Once only one team has units left on the field, that team wins.
