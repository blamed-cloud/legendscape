Stuff to consider adding to legendscape:		(*: marks a neccesary update)	(+: marks an update that has been added)
	-natures, perks or other bonuses to make units slightly different
*	-a password set by each player to move to their turn
*	-a command phase, where the player can:
+		-view the units hp (theirs, and the opponents that they know about)
*		-view the base stats of all units, as well as what natures do
		-buy more units (when that gets implemented) (units would appear the next turn, not the turn they are purchased)
*	-an AI (for computer opponents, or randomly spawned aggressive monsters)
*	-graphical display
	-flanking bonus
	-new units:
		-siege units: (can attack walls)
			-catapult
			-ballista
			-trebuchet
		-suicide bomber
		-shield wall	(lots of defense, possible counter-striking ability, maybe block line of sight)
		-thief (loots more money from chests, maybe pickpocket enemies, and can go stealth mode)
		larger/flying units:
			-Dragons (L&F)
			-Bear (L)
			-Troll (L)
			-Ogre (L)
			-Serpent (L)
			-griffon (F) (airstrike maybe)
		-Necromancer
			-animated corpse
		-paladin (bonus atk against undead)
	-area attacks & attacks that target squares not enemies
		-new attack system, where you 'move' the attack, instead of numbers corresponding to units
*	-gametype selection:
+		-number of players
+		-shroud on/off
+		-fog-of-war on/off
		-conquest / siege / control / king defense / undead horde / ritual
*			-conquest is two armies fighting until all units of opposing team are dead
			-siege is one team in the castle, other team(s) is(are) trying to take/destroy the castle.
*			-control would be like battlefront2, where there are outposts throughout the map, and you have to hold them (maybe all or just most) for x-number of turns and you win.
			-king defense: teams would have a king-unit that is stronger, but if it dies, you lose the game.
			-undead horde: player in castle, player (or computer) in graveyard with necromancer.
			-ritual: one player is trying to complete a ritual, the other team is trying to stop them.
